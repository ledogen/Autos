# BUG-56: junction fork disjunction — minor leg arrives as a floating shelf over a stepped carve cliff

**Owner, 2026-08-24:** "junctions need a pass to fix the disjunction" — screenshot at
**seed 6, near (−1576, 1361)** (HUD POS line; free-cam view). A Y-fork where the minor leg's
ribbon rides in as a thin shelf hovering over a stepped carve wall, with a metres-tall vertical
tear where it should blend into the major road's surface. The terrain under the fork is cut in
visible stair-steps; the shelf has no earthwork under its outer edge at all.

The owner accepted the BUG-55 area itself as looking great — this is the junction-surface class
that remains around it.

## What we know going in (do the diagnosis fresh at the spot — do not assume)

- The v2 assembly grades each edge standalone and reconciles shared nodes via the junction
  blend + pad; the pad plane is clamped to ~7 % grade (mergePadArrivalMax exists precisely
  because arrival-grade vs pad-plane mismatch × pad reach is a measured collision-cliff class).
- Carve composition at forks is the triple-overlay; a stepped wall under a fork means the two
  legs' carve bodies disagree about the design height across the shared footprint.
- Deletions can rebuild a pad from fewer legs (BUG-55 phase 5 watch item) — this node is near
  the nest, so check whether it lost a leg and whether the rebuilt pad is the tear.
- graph-topology (f) NODE-DEPARTURE is booked separately (bearing); if one pass fixes both,
  fine, but do not fold its re-baselining into this ticket silently.

First moves: `node test/capture-classify.mjs 6 -1576 1361` for the runs/merge state at the node;
`RoadSystem.debugSampleAt` / carve-mesh probes across the fork for the height series of each
surface; identify WHICH surface (leg ribbon, pad, carve floor) owns the step.

## Acceptance

- At the captured fork: the legs and the junction surface meet with no vertical tear and no
  unsupported shelf — the carve under the fork is a single reconciled footprint, not stairs.
- A sweep of seed-3/seed-6 junctions (the eleven-mark windows are fine as the sample) shows no
  remaining floating-shelf forks.
- carve-mesh-smoothness and road-smoothness stay green (lone-pine canary allowed); no new reds
  in `npm run test:all`.
- MESH == PHYSICS holds at the fork (drive over it; no invisible step).
