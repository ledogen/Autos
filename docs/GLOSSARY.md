# RangerSim Physics Glossary

This glossary defines the coordinate system, sign conventions, and physics terms used by every `src/*.js` file in RangerSim. It is the source of truth — when a code comment refers to `slip angle` or `forward vector` or `quaternion integration`, the definition lives here. New terms must be added to this file before they appear in code.

---

## Coordinate System

Three.js uses a **Y-up right-handed world space**. RangerSim adopts this system without modification:

| Axis | Direction | Meaning at heading 0 |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| +X   | Right      | World right          |
| +Y   | Up         | World up             |
| -Z   | Forward    | Car forward at heading 0 |

**Heading 0 convention:** When the car has identity quaternion orientation (no rotation applied), it points down the **-Z axis**. "Forward" in body space is the vector `(0, 0, -1)` in local coordinates.

**No conversion layers exist anywhere in this codebase.** Physics math uses Three.js axes directly. There is no SAE, ISO, or automotive-standard axis conversion layer. Named vectors (see below) are the readability mechanism — not axis remapping.

---

## Named Vectors (Body Space)

Three named unit vectors are used everywhere physics is written. They are always derived from `vehicleState.quaternion` by rotating base-axis vectors into world space:

| Name      | Body-Space Basis | World-Space Derivation |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `forward` | `(0, 0, -1)`    | `new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1).applyQuaternion(vehicleState.quaternion)` |
| `right`   | `(1, 0, 0)`     | `new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0).applyQuaternion(vehicleState.quaternion)`  |
| `up`      | `(0, 1, 0)`     | `new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0).applyQuaternion(vehicleState.quaternion)`  |

**Enforcement rule:** Any time a module computes "the direction the car is pointing" it **MUST** construct that vector from this quaternion rotation. It is **NEVER** acceptable to derive the forward vector from `Math.atan2(velocity.x, velocity.z)` or from a stored Euler `heading` scalar. Those approaches fail at 90° pitch/roll (gimbal lock).

---

## Sign Conventions

### Slip Angle

Slip angle is the angle between the wheel's **heading direction** (its `forward` vector after steer rotation) and the **velocity vector at the wheel contact patch**.

**Positive sign convention:** Counter-clockwise when viewed from above in the Y-up right-hand system. Equivalently: positive slip angle corresponds to the contact patch velocity pointing to the **wheel's left** (in the wheel's local frame).

**Phase note:** Phase 1 does not use slip angle math (D-08 — velocity damping only). The convention is documented here for Phase 3 Pacejka implementation.

### Torque

Positive torque about an axis follows the **right-hand rule** with the axis as the thumb:

- Point right thumb along +Y → fingers curl counter-clockwise viewed from above
- Yaw torque about +Y produces **counter-clockwise yaw** viewed from above
- This matches the Three.js/OpenGL right-hand convention

World-frame torques applied in `physics.js` accumulate into `angularVelocity` (also world-frame).

### Steering Angle (Scalar, NOT Euler)

`vehicleState.steerAngle` is a **scalar in radians**, not an Euler angle for body rotation.

- **Positive steerAngle** = steer left (counter-clockwise viewed from above, consistent with positive yaw about +Y)
- `steerAngle` is a separate per-frame input scalar consumed by Ackermann geometry to compute front wheel angles
- Body rotation remains a `THREE.Quaternion` at all times — `steerAngle` never modifies `vehicleState.quaternion` directly

**Do not confuse** the scalar steer angle with Euler body rotation. They are completely separate concepts.

---

## Quaternion Integration Convention

`vehicleState.quaternion` (a `THREE.Quaternion`) represents the car body's orientation in world space. It is integrated each physics step as follows:

**Step 1 — Angular velocity:** `angularVelocity` is stored in **WORLD frame** (rad/s) as a `THREE.Vector3`.

**Step 2 — Build delta quaternion:**
```javascript
const axis = angularVelocity.clone().normalize();
const angle = angularVelocity.length() * dt;
const dq = new THREE.Quaternion().setFromAxisAngle(axis, angle);
```

**Step 3 — Left-multiply (world-frame convention):**
```javascript
vehicleState.quaternion.premultiply(dq);  // equivalent to: dq * q
```

**Step 4 — Normalize to prevent drift:**
```javascript
vehicleState.quaternion.normalize();
```

**Step 5 — Guard against zero rotation:**
```javascript
if (angularVelocity.length() < 1e-10) return;  // skip update this frame
```

**Rationale:** Physics forces accumulate in world space, so `angularVelocity` is world-frame. Using `premultiply(dq)` (i.e., `dq * q`) applies a world-frame rotation increment. If angular velocity were stored in body space, `q.multiply(dq)` (i.e., `q * dq`) would be correct instead. This project uses world-frame `premultiply`.

**Always call `normalize()` immediately after every integration step.** Floating-point multiplication of unit quaternions accumulates tiny errors that compound over thousands of steps.

## Term Definitions

### Slip Angle

The angle between the wheel's **heading direction** and the **contact patch velocity vector**.

- **Unit:** radians
- **Sign:** Positive = velocity pointing left of heading (counter-clockwise viewed from above)
- **Phase 3** will use slip angle as the input to the Pacejka Magic Formula lateral force calculation

### Normal Force (`Fn`)

The contact force exerted by the ground on a wheel's contact patch, acting in the **+Y direction** (world up, Three.js convention). Opposes gravity and prevents ground penetration.

- **Unit:** N (Newtons)
- **Symbol:** `Fn` — named for the physical role (normal to the contact surface), NOT the SAE Z-axis label `Fz`. This project uses Three.js Y-up axes throughout; the ground reaction acts in +Y, never +Z.
- **Phase 1:** Computed per-wheel from impulse-based rigid ground contact. No spring stiffness constant — wheel-to-body geometry is rigid.
- **Phase 4:** Computed from spring-damper compression at each corner, enabling dynamic load transfer.

**Naming rule:** Always use `Fn` in code. Never use `Fz` for this quantity — that is SAE convention and contradicts the project coordinate system (GLOSSARY §Coordinate System).

### Contact Patch Velocity

The velocity vector at the location where the tire meets the ground. Computed as:

```
v_contact = vehicleState.velocity + vehicleState.angularVelocity × (wheelContactPoint − vehicleState.position)
```

Where `×` is the vector cross product. The contact patch velocity is then decomposed into:

- **Longitudinal component** (`Flong`): projection along the wheel's `forward` vector → used for drive/brake force and rolling resistance
- **Lateral component** (`Flat`): projection along the wheel's `right` vector → used for lateral (side) tire force

- **Unit:** m/s (both components)

### Longitudinal Slip Ratio (kappa)

The ratio between wheel surface speed and vehicle ground speed, measuring how much the wheel spins faster or slower than the ground.

- **Formula:** `kappa = (omega * r - v_x) / max(|omega * r|, |v_x|, epsilon)` where `epsilon = 0.1 m/s` (SLIP_EPSILON — prevents 0/0 at rest)
- **Unit:** dimensionless
- **Range:** [-1, +1]
- **Sign:** Positive = wheel spinning faster than ground (wheelspin / acceleration); negative = wheel rotating slower than ground (braking / locked wheel)
- **Used by:** `computeLongitudinalForce` in `src/tire.js` via the slip ratio computed in `src/physics.js`

### Wheel Angular Velocity (omega_wheel / wheelOmega)

Per-wheel spin rate in radians per second. Distinct from the vehicle body angular velocity (`vehicleState.angularVelocity`).

- **Unit:** rad/s
- **Storage:** `vehicleState.wheelOmega[4]` — per-wheel array (index convention: 0=FL, 1=FR, 2=RL, 3=RR)
- **Integration:** Integrated in `src/physics.js` each physics step via the omega integrator: `wheelOmega[i] += (driveTorque - roadReactionTorque - brakeTorque) / wheelInertia * dt`
- **Debug copy:** `vehicleState.wheelDebug[i].omega` — written each contact step; read by the logger and the Pacejka plot
- **Distinct from:** `vehicleState.wheelAngles[4]` which accumulates visual spin angle for mesh rendering; `wheelOmega` drives physics, `wheelAngles` drives the mesh `rotation.x`

### Pacejka B Coefficient (Stiffness Factor)

The B coefficient in the Pacejka Magic Formula. Shapes the initial slope of the tire force curve — higher B increases the cornering stiffness (how quickly force builds with slip).

- **Range (slider):** 5 to 20
- **Default:** 10.0
- **Used by:** `computeLateralForce` and `computeLongitudinalForce` in `src/tire.js`

### Pacejka C Coefficient (Shape Factor)

The C coefficient in the Pacejka Magic Formula. Controls the overall shape of the force curve (how peaked vs. rounded the curve is).

- **Hard constraint:** Must be in range `[1.0, 1.99]`. At C ≥ 2.0, `sin(C * atan(...))` can produce zero or oscillatory output (curve collapse). The range `[1.0, 1.99]` guarantees a well-behaved bell-shaped curve.
- **Enforcement:** Hard-clamped via `Math.max(1.0, Math.min(1.99, params.pacejkaC))` inside both tire functions in `src/tire.js` AND inside `updatePacejkaCurve` in `src/debug.js` (defense in depth — T-03-07).
- **Range (slider):** 1.0 to 1.99
- **Default:** 1.9

### Pacejka D Coefficient (Peak Factor)

The D coefficient in the Pacejka Magic Formula. Scales the peak force magnitude. Effective peak force = D × Fz (normal force). At D = 1.0, peak force equals the normal force (μ = 1.0, dry tarmac equivalent).

- **Range (slider):** 0.5 to 2.0
- **Default:** 1.0
- **Used by:** `computeLateralForce` and `computeLongitudinalForce` in `src/tire.js`

### Pacejka E Coefficient (Curvature Factor)

The E coefficient in the Pacejka Magic Formula. Controls the post-peak falloff shape — how abruptly the tire force drops after the slip angle exceeds the peak.

- **Range (slider):** -1.0 to 1.0
- **Default:** 0.97 (near 1.0 → realistic gradual post-peak falloff)
- **Note:** At E = 1.0 the curve falls off most gradually; at E = -1.0 the peak is sharper and the falloff steeper.

### Friction Circle

The combined lateral/longitudinal force envelope for a tire contact patch. A tire can only produce a limited total force proportional to `frictionCoeff * Fn`. If the vector sum of lateral and longitudinal forces exceeds this budget, both are scaled down proportionally.

- **Formula:** `combinedForce = sqrt(Flat² + Flong²)`; if `combinedForce > frictionCoeff * Fn`, both `Flat` and `Flong` are multiplied by `frictionBudget / combinedForce`
- **Implemented in:** `src/physics.js` friction circle scaling block (runs after force computation, before omega integration — constraint #5)
- **Effect:** Drifting consumes longitudinal traction budget; hard braking reduces available lateral cornering force

### Handbrake

Rear-only braking applied via the Space key. Engages at full `params.maxHandbrakeTorque` on rear wheels while the key is held.

- **Input:** Space key — `e.key === ' '` comparison in `src/vehicle.js` keydown/keyup listeners
- **State:** `vehicleState.handbrake = true` while Space held; written by `updateVehicle` each step
- **Force path:** `getBrakeTorque(i, vehicleState, params)` in `src/physics.js` — rear wheels (i ≥ 2) receive `params.maxHandbrakeTorque` when `vehicleState.handbrake === true`
- **Drift mechanics:** Rear wheels slow down → negative longitudinal slip ratio → reduced `Flong` → friction circle frees up lateral budget → Pacejka `Flat` can approach peak → drift develops naturally (not a hard omega lock)
- **Debug slider:** `maxHandbrakeTorque` in the RangerSim Debug panel (range 500–5000 N·m)

### Ackermann Geometry

Steering geometry where the **inner wheel** (turning toward the turn center) rotates by a **sharper angle** than the outer wheel. This minimizes tire scrub during a low-speed turn by making both front tires track concentric arcs whose center lies on the extended rear-axle line.

The exact formula used in this project (sin/cos form — avoids cotangent singularity):

```
φ_inner = atan( 2·L·sin(φ) / (2·L·cos(φ) − T·sin(φ)) )
φ_outer = atan( 2·L·sin(φ) / (2·L·cos(φ) + T·sin(φ)) )
```

Where:
- `φ` = reference steer angle (the `vehicleState.steerAngle` scalar), positive = steer left
- `L` = wheelbase = 2.85 m (2002 Ford Ranger)
- `T` = track width = 1.46 m (2002 Ford Ranger)

For a left turn (positive φ): left wheel is inner → `φ_inner = φ_left`, right wheel is outer → `φ_outer = φ_right`.

- **Unit:** radians (both input φ and output wheel angles)

## Wheel Index Convention

Every module that indexes into a per-wheel array uses this mapping:

| Index | Label | Position           |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| `0`   | FL (Front Left)  | Front Left  |
| `1`   | FR (Front Right) | Front Right |
| `2`   | RL (Rear Left)   | Rear Left   |
| `3`   | RR (Rear Right)  | Rear Right  |

This mapping applies to: `vehicleState.wheelAngles`, wheel mesh arrays in `main.js`, normal force arrays in `suspension.js`, and any per-wheel force arrays in `physics.js`.

---

## Frame Logger Fields

Log fields written by `src/logger.js` `captureFrame()` and recorded in the downloaded `.json` file. Field order matches the `FIELDS` constant in `src/logger.js` exactly (D-07). Each row in the `frames` array has 41 scalar values in this order. The first 33 fields are the original Phase 1/2 fields; fields 34–37 (`fl_omega`–`rr_omega`) are Phase 3 additions; fields 38–41 (`fl_fz`–`rr_fz`) are Phase 4 additions — all appended at END per constraint #8 (append-only contract — never reorder existing fields).

## Phase 4 Suspension Terms

The following terms are introduced in Phase 4 with the quarter-car suspension model (D-01 through D-15).

### Sprung Mass

The portion of vehicle mass supported by the suspension springs — the body, chassis, and drivetrain components that sit above the springs. In RangerSim: `mass · weightFront / 2` ≈ 374 kg per front corner and `mass · weightRear / 2` ≈ 306 kg per rear corner. Used in the natural-frequency formula `f_n = (1/2π)·√(k/m_sprung)` to derive `suspensionStiffness{Front,Rear}`.

### Unsprung Mass

The portion of vehicle mass NOT supported by the suspension springs — wheels, hubs, brake rotors, and stub axles. These components follow the road surface directly. In RangerSim: `params.wheelMass` ≈ 18 kg per corner, integrated as `vehicleState.hubY[i]` (vertical position) and `vehicleState.hubVy[i]` (vertical velocity) each physics substep.

### Suspension Travel

The displacement of the wheel hub relative to the body mount point along the spring axis. Compression is positive (hub moves toward body); extension (droop) brings the hub away from body. Rest length `suspensionRestLength{Front,Rear}` sets the spring-at-rest length; `suspComp = restLength - currentLength` is the signed compression used in the spring-force calculation. Zero travel means the wheel is at its design ride height.

### Ride Height

The height of the vehicle body above the ground at static equilibrium — where spring compression and gravity balance. In RangerSim: computed at spawn by `computeStaticEquilibrium(params)` in `src/main.js`. Formula per corner: `tireComp = cornerMass · g / k_T`; `suspComp = sprungMass · g / k_S`; `hubY = wheelRadius − tireComp`; `bodyY_at_mount = hubY + restLength − suspComp`. The CG height at spawn is approximately 0.42 m (lower than the tuning estimate of `cgHeight = 0.55 m` because suspension compresses under load — this is correct physics).

### Anti-Roll Bar (ARB)

A torsional spring linking the left and right wheels of an axle that resists differential compression (body roll). When the left spring compresses more than the right, the ARB applies an equal and opposite force to each side, stiffening the axle against roll. In RangerSim: bilinear-spring approximation (D-07) where `F_arb = arbStiffness{Front,Rear} · (suspComp[left] − suspComp[right])` per axle; `−F_arb` applied to the left hub, `+F_arb` to the right hub. Tunable via `arbStiffnessFront` and `arbStiffnessRear` sliders. A stiffer front ARB relative to rear promotes understeer balance.

### Substep / Physics Timestep Convention

The outer physics step (`PHYSICS_DT = 1/60` s, per D-09) integrates the 6DOF rigid body. The suspension vertical sub-system runs at `N = 2` fixed sub-steps of `sdt = PHYSICS_DT / 2` each outer step to maintain stability of the stiff tire-spring ODE (D-08). All literals `1/60` in source code must be replaced with `PHYSICS_DT` (or `params.physicsDt`) — never hardcode `0.0167`. The substep count `N` and size `sdt` are fixed constants, not user-tunable. See `stepSuspensionSubsteps` in `src/suspension.js`.

---

## Phase 4.1 Suspension Terms (Strut-Axis Model)

The following terms are introduced in Phase 4.1 with the body-frame strut-compression model (D-01 through D-15).

### strut axis

The body-local up/down axis along which the strut translates. Body-fixed; rotates with the body quaternion. Derived in code as `new THREE.Vector3(0, -1, 0).applyQuaternion(vehicleState.quaternion)` (body_down). The strut can only compress or extend along this axis — lateral forces on the hub transmit instantly to the body through the rail constraint.

### strutComp

Strut compression from rest length [m]; positive = compressed below rest. State per corner; stored in `vehicleState.strutComp[4]` (index 0=FL, 1=FR, 2=RL, 3=RR). At static equilibrium, `strutComp[i] ≈ m_sprung_corner * g / k_S` (≈ 111 mm at current Ranger params). Logged as `fl_sc`/`fr_sc`/`rl_sc`/`rr_sc` in the scenario log (Phase 4.1 D-12 addition).

### strutCompVel

Rate of strut compression [m/s]; positive = compressing (hub moving toward body). State per corner; stored in `vehicleState.strutCompVel[4]`. Integrated by the hub ODE in `stepSuspensionSubsteps`. Used to compute suspension damping force `F_damp = -c * strutCompVel`.

### bump stop

Penalty spring engaging when `strutComp >= suspensionTravel`. Zero force at the engagement boundary; linear force past it: `F_bump = bumpStopStiffness * (strutComp - travel)`. Stiffness exposed as the "Bump Stop Stiffness" slider in the debug panel (range 10 000–500 000 N/m, default 330 000 N/m ≈ 10× front spring). The bump stop prevents the strut from collapsing without a physical stop.

### droop stop

Penalty spring engaging when `strutComp <= 0` (fully extended). Fixed constant `DROOP_STOP_STIFFNESS = 20 000 N/m` — not a slider. At hub weight (~18 kg) deflection is < 10 mm (design target). Prevents the hub from floating away from the body when the wheel is airborne. The droop stop is a light constraint; wheels visually stop at full droop and don't continue extending infinitely.

### body offset (suspensionBodyOffsetFront / suspensionBodyOffsetRear)

Y shift of the suspension mount point in body space [m]; controls ride height. Positive value lowers the mount (raises ride height). Default 0 = current geometry unchanged (mount at `-(cgHeight - wheelRadius)` in body-Y). Exposed as "Front Body Offset" and "Rear Body Offset" sliders in the debug panel (range −0.10 to +0.10 m, step 0.005 m).

### hub slider

Conceptual model for the suspension DOF: the hub is a rigid 1D slider constrained to translate only along the strut axis (body_down direction). The only degree of freedom is `strutComp`; lateral forces on the hub (from road contact normal X/Z residuals) transmit instantly to the body through the rail constraint and are applied as direct body forces via `_hubNormalXZ` (Step 2.6 in `src/physics.js`). There is no hub lateral compliance modeled.

| Damping coefficient (c) | Phase 4 | See Suspension Travel |
| Normal force load transfer | Phase 4 | See Sprung Mass / ARB |
| Ride height | Phase 4 | See Ride Height |

---

## Phase 6 — Procedural Terrain

### chunk

A 64×64-unit tile of heightmap terrain. Each chunk is backed by a 65×65 `Float32Array` of height values (one sample per metre cell edge, plus one to close the far edge). Identified by integer grid coordinates `(cx, cz)` where `cx = Math.floor(wx / 64)`. Generated by the `TerrainSystem` Web Worker on demand and cached in `_chunkMap` until the car moves out of the 5×5 chunk ring.

### heightmap

A 2D grid of height values represented as a `Float32Array(65 * 65)`, stored in row-major order (`heights[zi * 65 + xi]`). Each cell covers 1.0 m in world space. The raw noise values are multiplied by `terrainAmplitude` before being used in physics queries (`sampleHeight`) and before being written to GPU geometry (`_flushPendingQueue`), guaranteeing the contact surface and the rendered surface are always co-located.

### bilinear interpolation

An O(1) height lookup within a single terrain cell using the four corner heights weighted by fractional position within the cell. Used by `sampleHeight()` in `TerrainSystem`:

```
h = h00*(1-fx)*(1-fz) + h10*fx*(1-fz) + h01*(1-fx)*fz + h11*fx*fz
```

where `fx` and `fz` are the fractional offsets within the cell (0 to 1). Produces smooth continuous terrain height at any world-space position, avoiding the staircase artefacts of nearest-neighbour lookup.

### terrainAmplitude

A `RANGER_PARAMS` field (float, default `1.0`). Scale multiplier applied to raw simplex noise heights during chunk geometry build (`_flushPendingQueue`) and height queries (`sampleHeight`). Higher values produce steeper hills; `1.0` = default ~6 m hills; `3.0` = maximum ~18 m hills. Tunable live via the Terrain folder in the debug panel (slider range 0.1–3.0, step 0.05). Because the multiplier is applied identically in physics and visual geometry, changing the value does not create a mismatch between the contact surface and the rendered surface.

### chunk ring

The 5×5 set of chunks surrounding the car's current chunk position, maintained by `TerrainSystem.update()` each render frame. `RING_RADIUS = 2`, so the ring extends two chunks in each cardinal direction from the car's chunk — covering a 320 m visible radius. Chunks that fall outside the ring are disposed (geometry freed via `geometry.dispose()`); chunks inside the ring that are not yet loaded are requested from the worker. The ring ensures the terrain is always available within the physics contact query range while bounding GPU memory use to at most 25 active chunk meshes.
